Using 100000 as the number of Monte Carlo statistics.
Using 10 as the total number of players.
Generating 7 different distributions.

DISCRETE
Percentage of games that are definite wins is 27 %
Percentage of games that are definite losses is 27 %
Percentage of games that you can influence is 45 %

Now assuming perfect play (you always score a 1):
Percentage of games that you will win is 72 %
Percentage of games that you will lose is 27 %
