Using 1000000 as the number of Monte Carlo statistics.
Using 12 as the total number of players.
Generating 7 different distributions.

DISCRETE
Percentage of games that are definite wins is 29 %
Percentage of games that are definite losses is 29 %
Percentage of games that you can influence is 41 %

Now assuming perfect play (you always score a 1):
Percentage of games that you will win is 70 %
Percentage of games that you will lose is 29 %
